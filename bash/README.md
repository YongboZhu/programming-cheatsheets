understanding of bash programming is vital when working with ebuilds.*

Try to **avoid** the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide at <http://tldp.org/>, because it "has a lot of information that is hard to find, is outdated and often unsafe. To be avoided until you can filter out the good stuff.". The Bash Programming Introduction HowTo is "absolute crap, [as it contains] many syntax errors alone." (citation from the Bash Hackers Wiki).

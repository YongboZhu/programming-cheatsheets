\subsection{Time access/conversions (\texttt{time})}
Time-related functions are provided by this, \texttt{datetime} and \texttt{calendar} modules.

\begin{compactenum}
	\item \python{time.time()} returns seconds since the Unix Epoch.

	\item \python{time.asctime()} makes \python{time.localtime()} more readable.

	\item \python{time.sleep(seconds)} suspends execution of the calling thread.
\end{compactenum}

To-do: describe \texttt{datetime}.

A comment starts with a hash character \mintinline{python}{#

\subsection{Conditionals}
\begin{minted}{python}
if expression:
  commands
elif expression:
  commands:
else:
  commands
\end{minted}

\subsection{Loops}
\begin{minted}{python}
while expression:   for element in list:
  commands            commands
else:               else:
  commands            commands
\end{minted}

Note: A \mintinline{python}{break} statement executed in the first suite terminates 
the loop without executing the \mintinline{python}{else} clause's suite.

To terminate immediately the nearest enclosing loop, use  \mintinline{python}{break}.
To skip to the next iteration instead, use \mintinline{python}{continue}.

Loopnig on dictionaries and sets loops on keys.
